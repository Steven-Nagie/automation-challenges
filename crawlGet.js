/*
Challenge 7

Extension of last project.  Use the crawler and catalog every word used and the number of instance each word occurs.

1. Go to https://www.skiutah.com/

2. Use the crawler written in the past challenges and write a method to keep track of all the words on each page on the site and return to me a list or dictionary of words that exists on the site.  Also send me the list or dictionary in a text document.

// I would think we would catalog this very similarly to the way we cataloged links in the last project. Check if the word already exists in our dictionary array. If it does, ignore it, if it doesn't, put it in there.

//As far as actually obtaining every word, how do we loop through every element to get at its text()? Is there a way to do html.text(), or body.text()?
